class TensorProduct(nn.Module):
    r"""Computes the tensor product of two equivariant feature tensors.

    Supports two main modes controlled by ``feature_mode``:

    - ``'uvw'``: Fully connected tensor product.

      - Input1 shape: ``(..., irreps_in1.dim, channels_in1)``
      - Input2 shape: ``(..., irreps_in2.dim, channels_in2)``
      - Weight shape: ``(num_paths, channels_in1, channels_in2, channels_out)``
      - Output shape: ``(..., irreps_out.dim, channels_out)``

    - ``'uuu'``: Depthwise/elementwise tensor product.
      with ``uuu`` instructions (often used for self-interaction).

      - Input1 shape: ``(..., irreps_in1.dim, channels)``
      - Input2 shape: ``(..., irreps_in2.dim, channels)``
      - Weight shape: ``(num_paths, channels_out)`` (where ``channels_out`` usually equals ``channels``)
      - Output shape: ``(..., irreps_out.dim, channels_out)``

    Args:
        irreps_in1 (Irreps): Irreducible representations of the first input tensor.
        irreps_in2 (Irreps): Irreducible representations of the second input tensor.
        irreps_out (Irreps): Irreducible representations of the output tensor.
        channels_in1 (int, optional): Number of channels for the first input.
            Required if ``internal_weights=True`` or ``feature_mode='uvw'``.
        channels_in2 (int, optional): Number of channels for the second input.
            Required if ``internal_weights=True`` or ``feature_mode='uvw'``.
        channels_out (int, optional): Number of channels for the output.
            Required if ``internal_weights=True``.
        internal_weights (bool, default=True): If ``True``, the module manages its own weight parameter.
            If ``False``, weights must be provided during the forward pass.
        feature_mode ({'uuu', 'uvw'}, default='uuu'): Controls the type of tensor product:

            - ``'uuu'``: Depthwise/elementwise product. Assumes ``channels_in1 == channels_in2 == channels_out``.
            - ``'uvw'``: Fully connected product.
        path_norm (bool, default=True): Whether to apply path normalization to the weights.
        channel_norm (bool, default=False): Whether to apply channel normalization (specific to ``'uvw'`` mode).
            Divides weights by :math:`\sqrt{\text{channels_in1} \times \text{channels_in2}}`.
        path (list, optional): Manually specify the coupling paths.
            If ``None``, all allowed paths are used.

    Attributes:
        weight (torch.nn.Parameter or None): The learnable weights of the module if ``internal_weights=True``.
            Shape depends on ``feature_mode``.
        tp_info_forward (TensorProductInfo): Constant information for the forward pass computation.
        tp_info_backward1 (TensorProductInfo): Constant information for the backward pass w.r.t. input1.
        tp_info_backward2 (TensorProductInfo): Constant information for the backward pass w.r.t. input2.
        num_paths (int): Number of coupling paths determined by the irreps.
        weight_numel (int): Total number of elements in the weight tensor.
